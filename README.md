# Asymmetrik-Coding-Challenge

Challange: Business Card OCR
Language: Python
Environment(That I used): Cygwin

Steps for running/testing:

1. Running AssymetricCodingChallenge.py will open up a GUI with two text boxes an input and an output. 
2. The data from the Business card should be entered on separate lines in the input box (as in the provided examples)
3. Once the data has been inputed, pressing the submit button will parse the information provided and produce an output in the 
   output text box.
